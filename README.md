# libwm

A small library for X window manipulation

## documentation

Here is the full list of all the functions provided by `libwm`:

    wm_init_xcb();
    wm_kill_xcb();
    wm_is_alive(wid);
    wm_is_ignored(wid);
    wm_is_listable(wid, mask);
    wm_is_mapped(wid);
    wm_get_focus();
    wm_get_screen();
    wm_get_windows(wid, **list);
    wm_get_attribute(wid, attr);
    wm_get_cursor(mode, wid, *x, *y);
    wm_set_border(width, color, wid);
    wm_set_focus(wid);
    wm_set_cursor(x, y, mode);
    wm_set_override(wid, mode);
    wm_teleport(wid, w, h, x, y);
    wm_move(wid, mode, x, y);
    wm_remap(wid, mode);
    wm_resize(wid, mode, w, h);
    wm_restack(wid, mode);

Their usage is specified in the `wm.h` header file, as it is quite small for
now.

## installation

`libwm` provides two files: libwm.a and wm.h.  
You can build/install them as follows:

    $ make
    # make install

The makefile supports 2 macros: DESTDIR and PREFIX.

To link your program against it, compile it as follows:

    cc pgm.c -lwm -o pgm
